You have been given an integer 'N'. Your task is to generate and return all binary strings of length 'N' such that there are no consecutive 1's in the string.



A binary string is that string which contains only ‘0’ and ‘1’.



For Example:
Let ‘N'=3, hence the length of the binary string would be 3. 

We can have the following binary strings with no consecutive 1s:
000 001 010 100 101 


void helper(int ind,int allowed,string temp,vector<string> &ans){
    if (ind<0){
        ans.push_back(temp);
        return;
    }
    helper(ind-1,1,temp+'0',ans);
    if (allowed){
        helper(ind-1,0,temp+'1',ans);
    }
    return;
}


vector<string> generateString(int N) {
    vector<string> ans;
    // 1 means that you can take 1
    helper(N-1,1,"",ans);
    return ans;
}
