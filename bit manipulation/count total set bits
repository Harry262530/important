For a given integer 'N', you have to return the number of set bits in the binary representation of the numbers from 1 to 'N'.



In a binary number '1' is considered as a set bit and '0' as not set.



Example:

Explain
If 'N' is 4, then

1 has a binary representation of 1
2 has a binary representation of 10
3 has a binary representation of 11
4 has a binary representation of 100

Hence number of set bits is 5.

int countSetBits(int n)
{
    int count=0;
    for (int i=1;i<=n;i++){
        // n and n-1 approach, agar n ko n-1 ke sath and krenge to pehla set bit from right will be settles and do that again till we get a zero
        int num=i;
        while (num!=0){
            num=(num&(num-1));
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
