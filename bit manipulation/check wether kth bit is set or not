Problem statement
Given a number ‘N’ and a number ‘K’. Return true if ‘K’th bit of number is set, else return false.



Example:

Explain
Input: ‘N’ = 5, ‘K’ = 1

Output: YES

5 in binary can be written as 101 and as we can see a first bit from the right of 5 is set so the answer is 'YES'.

bool isKthBitSet(int n, int k)
{
    // pehle thik kth bit tak ka 1 le jao like if k=2, then left shift one by 1 place so 10 will be the number, then perform and with the n, which will make all other bit 0, but if the kth bit of n was 1, the the and will become 1 and output will not be zero
    return (n&(1<<(k-1)))!=0;
}
