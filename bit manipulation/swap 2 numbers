You are given two numbers 'a' and 'b' as input.



You must swap the values of 'a' and 'b'.



For Example:

Explain
Input: 
'a' = 8, 'b' = 5

Output:
5 8

void swapNumber(int &a, int &b) {
	a=a^b;
	b=a^b; //(initial a^b nor ^b) after this b=a
	a=a^b; //initially a=a^b then xor with b which is equal to a will give b;
}
