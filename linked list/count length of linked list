Given the head of a singly linked list of integers, find and return its length.


Example:

The length of the list is 4. Hence we return 4.

Note:
Exercise caution when dealing with edge cases, such as when the head is NULL. Failing to handle these edge cases appropriately may result in a runtime error in your code.

Sample Input 1 :
3 4 5 2 6 1 9 -1


Sample Output 1 :
7


Explanation of sample input 1 :
The number of nodes in the given linked list is 7.
Hence we return 7.


Sample Input 2 :
10 76 39 -3 2 9 -23 9 -1

Sample Output 2 :
8


  int length(Node *head)
{
    Node *curr=head;
    int count=0;
    while (curr!=NULL){
        count++;
        curr=curr->next;
    }
    return count;
}
